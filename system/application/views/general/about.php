		<p><b>agorabid.com</b> is an online marketplace for services; where people can buy and sell any kind of service using an auction style bidding platform. 
		It was designed specifically to make it easier for people to shop for services.</p>
		
		<p>The internet has revolutionized the way we shop for products. 
		We no longer have to go to multiple stores to compare prices and then gamble on the quality of the product. 
		With instant access to prices, ratings, and reviews shopping for products has becomes as simple as selecting 
		a product out of a list based on the best price and rating combination. It’s much faster, cheaper, and safer 
		to shop for products now than ever before.</p>
		
		<p>However, the way we shop for services has pretty much stayed the same. 
		New sites that have service provider reviews are popping up, but for the most part there aren’t enough reviews. 
		And the process still remains the same: (1) Search for a provider in your area, 
		(2) Call each one, describe the problem to each one, and (3) finally gamble on the quality of the service. 
		To sum it up, the only change that happened is that instead of searching through the paper yellow pages, 
		we now search through the internet yellow pages (google maps, yellowpages.com, ...).</p>
		
		<p>agorabid.com was created to try to change that. The way it works on agorabid.com is that the buyer creates a service request 
		(any kind of request imaginable: fix my car, my faucet leaks, I need my windows insulated, ...). 
		The buyer writes a description where he/she only describes the problem once. Then service providers bid on the request. 
		The buyer then chooses the best bidder, based on the rating and the price the bidder is offering.</p>
		
		<p>In the end, agorabid.com tries to make the process of buying a service like the process of buying a product, 
		you choose out of a list based on the best price and rating combination.</p>
